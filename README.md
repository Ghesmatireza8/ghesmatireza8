# üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm a Python developer with a passion for building powerful and user-friendly desktop applications using PyQt5. I enjoy turning ideas into real software that helps automate tasks, simplify workflows, and deliver useful solutions. With experience in both scripting and UI development, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and designing intuitive interfaces that enhance the user experience.<br><br>Most of my projects revolve around data scraping, utility tools, and task management apps. You‚Äôll find applications like web scrapers built with Playwright and BeautifulSoup, alarm clocks, to-do lists, timers, and cryptocurrency trackers‚Äîall developed with a focus on performance and usability. Each project reflects my interest in real-world problem solving and my desire to create tools that are both practical and visually appealing.
